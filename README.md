# PlayCode

# **Not just problem-solving — but solving with fun, flow, challenge, and joy**


A modern problem-solving & coding practice platform built with **Node.js (Express)** and **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**.  
The goal is to create a **unique, learner-friendly coding experience** with features like hints, analytics, and gamification.  

## 📌 Features (Planned)
- 🧩 **Progressive Hints** – Step-by-step guidance (concept → pseudo-code → solution).  
- 📊 **Personalized Analytics** – Track strengths/weaknesses across topics.  
- 🎮 **Gamification** – XP, streaks, badges, and challenges.    
- 📚 **Study Planner** – University-course-based practice roadmap.  
- 🏆 **Community Explanations** – Upvotable hints and tutorials.  
- 🌙 **Minimalist UI** – Distraction-free coding environment.
